### Executor 接口
- An object that executes submitted Runnable tasks. This interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread use, scheduling, etc. An Executor is normally used instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than invoking new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start() for each of a set of tasks, you might use:

- 一个执行提交的 Runnable任务的对象,此接口提供了一种将任务提交与每个任务的运行机制分离的方法,包括线程使用，调度等的详细信息。通常使用Executor而不是显式创建线程。例如,替代为一组任务调用Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start(),你可能会用
``` java
   Executor executor = anExecutor;
   executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
   executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
   ...
```   
- However, the Executor interface does not strictly require that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's thread:
但是，Executor接口并不严格要求执行是异步的。在最简单的情况下，执行程序可以立即在调用者的线程中运行提交的任务：
```java
 class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     r.run();
   }
 }
```
- More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other than the caller's thread. The executor below spawns a new thread for each task.
- 更典型地，任务在除调用者线程之外的某个线程中执行。下面的执行程序为每个任务生成一个新线程。  
```java
 class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     new Thread(r).start();
   }
 }
```
- Many Executor implementations impose some sort of limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled. The executor below serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor, illustrating a composite executor.
- 许多Executor的实现对任务的安排方式和时间施加了某种限制。下面的执行者将任务提交放到第二个执行程序，说明了一个复合执行程序。举例说明了一个复合executor.
```java
 class SerialExecutor implements Executor {
   final Queue<Runnable> tasks = new ArrayDeque<Runnable>();
   final Executor executor;
   Runnable active;

   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
     this.executor = executor;
   }

   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
     tasks.offer(new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
         try {
           r.run();
         } finally {
           scheduleNext();
         }
       }
     });
     if (active == null) {
       scheduleNext();
     }
   }

   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
       executor.execute(active);
     }
   }
 }
```
- The Executor implementations provided in this package implement ExecutorService, which is a more extensive interface. The ThreadPoolExecutor class provides an extensible thread pool implementation. The Executors class provides convenient factory methods for these Executors.
- 在这个包中Executor被提供的实现实现了ExecutorService,这是一个更广泛的接口,ThreadPoolExecutor类提供可扩展的线程池实现。 Executors类为这些Executor提供了方便的工厂方法。
- Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to submitting a Runnable object to an Executor happen-before its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.
- **内存一致性的影响:在线程中的在提交一个Runnable object到Executor之前的动作 happen-before its 执行.可能在另一个线程.**

### interface ExecutorService extends Executor
- An Executor that provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.
- 一个提供方法来管理终止和可以产生一个Future来追踪一个或多个异步任务的进度的方法的Executor
- An ExecutorService can be shut down, which will cause it to reject new tasks. Two different methods are provided for shutting down an ExecutorService. The shutdown method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before terminating, while the shutdownNow method prevents waiting tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks. Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted. An unused ExecutorService should be shut down to allow reclamation of its resources.
- 一个ExecutorService可以被shut down,这将造成它拒绝新任务,两个不同的方法被提供来关闭一个ExecutorService,shutdown方法将允许先前提交的任务在终止之前执行,然而shutdownNow方法阻止等待任务启动并且尝试停止正在运行的任务,。终止时，执行程序没有正在执行的任务，没有等待执行的任务，也没有任何新任务可以提交。应关闭未使用的ExecutorService以允许回收其资源。
- Method submit extends base method Executor.execute(Runnable) by creating and returning a Future that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion. Methods invokeAny and invokeAll perform the most commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to complete. (Class ExecutorCompletionService can be used to write customized variants of these methods.)
- submit方法 通过创建和返回一个可以被用来取消执行或等待完成的Future 扩展 基础方法Executor.execute(Runnable).方法 invokeAny和invokeAll perform 最常用的批量执行形式,然后等待至少一个或全部完成.(类ExecutorCompletionService可用于编写这些方法的自定义变体.)
- The Executors class provides factory methods for the executor services provided in this package.
- Executors类为 在这个包里的executor services提供工场方法
- Usage Examples
- Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured Executors.newFixedThreadPool factory method:
- 下面是网络服务的草图,其中线程池中的线程服务传入请求提供.它使用预配置的Executors.newFixedThreadPool工厂方法： 
```java
 class NetworkService implements Runnable {
   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
   private final ExecutorService pool;

   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
       throws IOException {
     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
   }

   public void run() { // run the service 运行服务
     try {
       for (;;) {
         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
       }
     } catch (IOException ex) {
       pool.shutdown();
     }
   }
 }

 class Handler implements Runnable {
   private final Socket socket;
   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
   public void run() {
     // read and service request on socket  //读和服务 socket中的请求
   }
 }
```
- The following method shuts down an ExecutorService in two phases, first by calling shutdown to reject incoming tasks, and then calling shutdownNow, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:
- 下面的方法分两个阶段关闭ExecutorService,首先调用shutdown以拒绝传入的任务,然后在必要时调用shutdownNow以取消任何延迟的任务： 
```java
 void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted 禁止新的任务被提交
   try {
     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate 等待一会让现有任务终止
     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks 取消当前正在执行的任务
       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled 等待一段时间让任务响应被取消
       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
           System.err.println("Pool did not terminate");
     }
   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted 如果当前线程被中断取消.
     pool.shutdownNow();
     // Preserve interrupt status 保留中断状态
     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
   }
 }
```
- Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the submission of a Runnable or Callable task to an ExecutorService happen-before any actions taken by that task, which in turn happen-before the result is retrieved via Future.get().
```java
public interface ExecutorService extends Executor {

    /**
     * Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted
     * tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
     * Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.
     *

     *         java.lang.RuntimePermission}{@code ("modifyThread")},
     *         or the security manager's {@code checkAccess} method

    void shutdown();

    /**

     * processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks
     * that were awaiting execution.
